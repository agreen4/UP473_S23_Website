    "text": "Course Overview and Objectives\nHousing represents a fundamental human need and a critical element of human settlements. Within the context of urban planning, housing represents one of the ways in which planning intervention has sought to ensure the health and safety of residents, while also bearing influence on the spatial, social, and economic relationships that differentiate housing and other land uses. Within this class, we will explore the policies and practices that constitute housing policy in the United States and abroad, in order to understand where and how planning strategies have been effective (and ineffective) at shaping physical, economic, social, and political dimensions of housing."

Grading criteria include contribution to the course environment, quality of writing, depth of analysis, and thoughtful engagement with the subject matter and each other. You work will be graded on a 100-point scale:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nPoint Range\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nA\n> 90 Points\nOutstanding work, ready for publication and dissemination\n\n\nB\n80 - 89 Points\nGood work, work needs minor revision\n\n\nC\n70 - 79 Points\nWork needs major revision\n\n\nD\n60 - 69 Points\nWork needs significant revision and rethinking\n\n\nF\n< 59 Points\nWork does not meet minimum standards\n\n\n\nConsistent contributions to discussion, thoughtful engagement with course material, and other achievements may lead to adjustments in course grades.\n\n\nAssignments\nYou can find more information on grade elements on the Assignments page.\nAll assignments should be submitted via Canvas as a PDF file (unless otherwise noted in the assignment). Late work will be automatically graded down by 5 points per 24-hour period your assignment is late, and will only be accepted if you have made arrangements with me prior to the assignment due date.\n\n\nAttendance\nThe learning environment in this seminar depends upon your participation. Full participation is expected for all course sessions. For each course session that you are absent from (excluding excused absences), 2 percent will be deducted from your final course grade. Excused absences will be granted on a case-by-case basis, but must be approved by me prior to the course session which you are absent from.\nFor those students who need to miss class due to a religious observance, please complete the Request for Accommodation for Religious Observances form should any instructors require an absence letter in order to manage the absence. In order to best facilitate planning and communication between students and faculty, we request that students make requests for absence letters as early as possible in the semester in which the request applies.\nFor more information on attendance policy as described in the University of Illinois Student Code, please see Sections 1-501 and 1-502.\n\n\nAccomodations for Students with Disabilities\nIf you need accommodations for any sort of disability, please make an office hours appointment so we can discuss your needs and ways I can support your learning. To ensure that disability-related concerns are properly addressed, students who require assistance to participate in this class should contact Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES). DRES provides students with academic accommodations, access, and support services. To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (V/TDD), or e-mail disability@illinois.edu."

    "text": "Honor Code and Learning Environment\nThe Illinois Student Code states: “It is the responsibility of each student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions.” Note that you are subject to the Honor Code, as well as procedures for addressing violations to the Code, regardless of whether you have read it and understand it. According to the Code, “ignorance is no excuse.”\nTo meet this standard in this class, note the following: in written work, all ideas (as well as data or other information) that are not your own must be cited. Note that ideas that require citation may not have been published or written down anywhere. While you are free—and indeed encouraged—to discuss the assignments with your peers, all of your data collection, analysis, and writing should be your own. Sharing of data sources you have been assigned to collect is a violation of the honor code in this course. The penalty for failing to meet the principles or spirit of the honor code may include automatic failure of the assignment or the class, at the discretion of the instructor.\nThe Department of Urban and Regional Planning is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is rooted in the goals and responsibilities of professional planners. By enrolling in a class offered by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, students agree to be responsible for maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect in all activities, including lectures, discussions, labs, projects, and extracurricular programs. See Student Code Article 1-Student Rights and Responsibilities, Part 1. Student Rights: §1-102.\n\nHealth and Safety\nFollowing University policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to protect the health and safety of the community. If you feel ill, do not come to class. In addition, if you test positive for COVID-19 or have had an exposure that requires testing and/or quarantine, do not attend class. Please notify me, and at my discretion, you will be given excused absences for these class sessions. We will also develop a plan to discuss how to make up any missed work.\n\n\nStaying in Touch\nAs you learn and face challenges this semester, I need you to communicate with me, either during our course sessions or individually. You can schedule an appointment with me at your convenience via my Calendly page. I promise to listen, to be a resource, and to help in any way that I can - if I can’t help you, I will find someone who can.\n\n\nSexual Misconduct Reporting Obligation\nThe University of Illinois is committed to combating sexual misconduct. Faculty and staff members are required to report any instances of sexual misconduct to the University’s Title IX and Disability Office. In turn, an individual with the Title IX and Disability Office will provide information about rights and options, including accommodations, support services, the campus disciplinary process, and law enforcement options.\nA list of the designated University employees who, as counselors, confidential advisors, and medical professionals, do not have this reporting responsibility and can maintain confidentiality, can be found here. Other information about resources and reporting is available at wecare.illinois.edu.\n\n\nMental Health\nThe University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings which are covered through the Student Health Fee. If you or someone you know experiences mental health concerns, please contact or visit any of the University’s resources provided below. Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do for yourself and for those who care about you.\n\nCounseling Center: (217) 333-3704\nMcKinley Health Center: (217) 333-2700\n988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline: (800) 273-8255\nRosecrance Crisis Line (217) 359-4141\n\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911."

    "text": "In seeking to intervene in local and regional housing environments, housing policy analysts face the challenge of describing past and present housing dynamics while also looking towards the future. This assignment asks you to practice these skills by developing an in-depth understanding of a regional housing market of your choice.\nAt a most basic level, housing policy analysts have to\na) describe the geography and composition of the housing market(s) they are analyzing;\nb) describe who gets what housing in those markets; and,\nc) describe the economic environment in which the housing markets operate.\nAfter distilling salient trends and features, housing policy analysts can then identify the overall health and function of the housing market, likely future influences, and special populations that should receive particular care or intervention.\nIn this assignment, you will begin defining and exploring a housing market of your choice, focusing on current conditions and housing market trends within the last 10 years. You will use multiple sources of secondary data to describe the local housing market, its demographic and economic conditions, trends for renters and owners, and likely future influences. You will also identify one or more specialized populations and will briefly describe their housing needs (your third assignment asks you to build upon your analysis by performing a detailed housing needs assessment for the specialized population you identify).\nYour housing market analysis should describe the following:\n\n Demographic Conditions: What are the salient demographic characteristics of the households in your housing market?\n Economic Conditions: What local or regional economic conditions shape the housing environment? How do the types of jobs that people have shape the economic environment for housing? How does housing consumption influence the local economic environment?\n Trends by Tenure: How do changes in the housing market differ for renters and owners?\n Future Influences: Based upon the recent past, what are likely future influences within the local housing market?\n Specialized Populations: Based upon your analysis of demographic conditions, economic conditions, and housing market trends, what specialized populations emerge who are particularly likely to face housing vulnerability in the future or who will be disparately impacted by the future influences you identify?\n\n\nThe Deliverable \nPrepare your profile as a memorandum of approximately 3,000 words (6 single-spaced pages, excluding tables, illustrations, and references). Your memorandum should include sufficient analysis and properly referenced evidence for another housing market expert to measure the strength and validity of your assertions. The judicious use of maps, imagery, and tables should be included to support your analysis.\nIn preparing your analysis, you may want to first look for other recent analyses of your local market. Good starting places would be to search for the most recent Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing, local Analysis of Fair Housing, HUD Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis, or for housing analysis completed as part of a neighborhood, local, or regional plan.\nPlease also note that I am not specifying or constraining the geography which you are required to conduct your analysis at. In selecting a particular geography, you’ll need to think carefully about what make sense – how does a particular geography constitute a housing market (or series of submarkets)? You will need to describe the definition you select and will need to justify your choice. Once you do, you should also plan to compare the characteristics of your local housing market (however you define it) to its region and the state in which it’s located.\nI encourage you to reach out to me as you work to define your market, to get confirmation that you have selected an appropriate geography. Keep in mind that you will be working with this selection over the course of the semester for your remaining assignments in the class.\n\n\nData Resources and Analytical Guidance \nOur class data repository includes R scripts as well as data tables for the primary indicators mentioned in this assignment.\nThe Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) is the first place to look for data that will help you to describe your housing market. The data.census.gov website allows you to query data for different survey years and geographies. To help you get started, I have downloaded data for the 2010 and 2019 5-year American Community Surveys at the census place level which are accessible on the course Box site. To successfully complete the assignment, you may also want to download data for other geographies or time periods on your own.\nBelow, you will find helpful information including ACS table numbers (e.g. the population table is B01003) as well as some guidance on initial analytical steps that will help you get started with your analysis:\n\nPopulation Demographics: Examine the demographic characteristics for your place and describe who lives here. Explore other ACS tables that may prove insightful. In reporting out demographic conditions, produce your own summaries of elements from ACS tables instead of reporting tables verbatim.\n\n\n\n\nINDICATOR\nACS TABLE NUMBER\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\nB01003\n\n\nRace B02001\n\n\n\nLatino Ethnicity\nB03002\n\n\nAge\nB01001\n\n\nHousehold Size\nB25010\n\n\nForeign Born Population\nB05002\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Conditions: Determine the median income for your housing market, as well as the incomes for those earning 120%, 80%, 50%, and 30% of median income\n\n\n\n\nINDICATOR\nACS TABLE NUMBER\n\n\n\n\nMedian Household Income\nB19013\n\n\nVacancy Rate\nB25002\n\n\n\n\nTrends by Tenure: Determine housing affordability for renters and owners at median income, 120%, 80%, 50%, and 30% of median income (remember that the federal standard for housing affordability is 30% of median income). Your analysis should compare monthly income to the median rent and owner costs (which are reported as monthly statistics) to determine for which percentages of median income the median priced housing unit is affordable.\n\nDetermine what percentage of median income is required to be able to afford the median rent and mortgage payments in your housing market.\n\n\n\nINDICATOR\nACS TABLE NUMBER\n\n\n\n\nTenure\nB25003\n\n\nMedian Rent\nB25064\n\n\nMedian Owner Costs\nB25088\n\n\n\n\n Future Influences: To examine future influences, you are going to perform some very crude projections of housing characteristics. You will find more information on performing these projections at the very end of this assignment.\n\n Based upon housing costs in 2010 and 2019, project housing costs for owners and renters to the year 2030.\n Based upon the median income in 2010 and 2019 project median income for 2030. What percentile of median income will be required in 2030 to afford to rent a median priced housing unit? What percentile of median income will be required to pay the mortgage on a median housing unit?\n Based upon change in housing units from 2010 and 2019, project the number of housing units that will be constructed in your place by 2030.\n How many new households do you project will live in your place by 2030? To calculate this, project the population to 2030 as well as the average household size and then use the ratio of population to average household size to approximate households.\n\n\n\n\nPerforming Simple Projections \nOne of the simplest methods of projection is to fit a line between two sets of observed points, and then project future values based upon that line.\nYou may remember from your past geometry training that the slope of a line can be calculated as follows:\nslope = (y2−y1)(x2−x1)\nLet’s calculate the change in population for a hypothetical location called Busytown. In 2010, the population of Busytown was 8,000 and by 2020 the population was 9,750. Here’s how we would find the annual rate of population change for Busytown between 2010 and 2020:\nchange = (9750−8000)(2020−2010)=175010=175\nBusytown’s population increased by 1,750 over 10 years – an increase of 175 people per year. If we assume that future population will grow at the same rate per year, we can now calculate the future population for Busytown in any future time period:\nPopulationFuture=PopulationBase+Change∗TimePeriods\nHere’s the equation for Busytown assuming a base year of 2020, and projecting the population to 2030, which is 10 years in the future:\nPopulationFuture=9750+175∗10\nTherefore, we project that if the population grows at the same rate it did between 2010 and 2020, the total population will be 9,750 + 3,250 = 11,500 in 2030.\n\n\nAssignment Submission \nPlease submit your paper electronically via Canvas."

    "text": "In your second assignment, you described elements of housing supply and demand and also identified the specific housing consumers present within your housing market. For this assignment, you will spend more time thinking about the housing needs associated with these consumers. Specifically, you will draw from elements of HUD’s Assessment of Fair Housing methodology to analyze your housing market’s demographics, patterns of spatial integration and segregation, and the intersectionality between housing and other needs. Together with your Housing Market Analysis, your Housing Needs Analysis will constitute the basis for your final assignment – a housing policy platform – which will focus on designing intervention to address the needs you identify within your local housing market.\nDrawing from the HUD AFFH Guidebook and the HUD AFFH Data, analyze the needs present within your local housing market. At a minimum, your housing needs analysis should address the following:\n\nDemographic Summary: Describe demographic patterns in the housing market and describe trends over time. Describe the location of homeowners and renters in the housing market, and describe trends over time.\n\nFor further guidance, see the AFFH Rule Guidebook §5.5.1.\n\nSegregation and Integration: Describe and compare segregation levels in the housing market and region. Identify the racial and ethnic groups that experience the highest levels of segregation. Explain how these segregation levels have changed over time.\n\nIdentify areas with relatively high segregation and integration by race/ethnicity, national origin, or LEP group, and indicate the predominant groups living in each area.\nConsider and describe the location of owner and renter occupied housing in determining whether such housing is located in segregated or integrated areas. Discuss how patterns of segregation have changed over time.\nDiscuss whether there are any demographic trends, policies, or practices that could lead to higher segregation in the jurisdiction in the future.\nFor further guidance, see the AFFH Rule Guidebook §5.5.2\n\nConcentration of Poverty: Identify any R/ECAPs or groupings of R/ECAP tracts within the jurisdiction. Which protected classes disproportionately reside in R/ECAPs compared to the housing market and region?\n\nDescribe how R/ECAPs have changed over time.\nFor further guidance, see the AFFH Rule Guidebook §5.5.3\n\nAccess to Opportunity: Describe disparities in access to opportunity, including access to education, employment, transportation, low poverty exposure, and environmentally healthy neighborhoods, as well as any overarching patterns relating to access to opportunity in the region.\n\nIdentify and discuss any overarching patterns of access to opportunity and exposure to adverse community factors based on race/ethnicity, national origin, or familial status. Identify areas that experience an aggregate of poor access to opportunity and high exposure to adverse factors.\nFor further guidance, see the AFFH Rule Guidebook §5.5.4\n\nDisproportionate Needs: What groups by race/ethnicity and family status experience higher and severe rates of housing cost burden, overcrowding, or substandard housing when compared to others?\n\nWhich areas in the housing market experience the greatest housing burdens, and how do these burdens align with segregated areas, integrated areas, R/ECAPs, and what is the predominant race/ethnicity or national origin group in such areas?\nFor further guidance, see the AFFH Rule Guidebook §5.5.5\n\nDisability and Access: How are persons with disabilities geographically dispersed or concentrated in the housing market, including R/ECAPs and other segregated areas identified in previous sections? Describe whether these geographic patterns vary for persons with each type of disability or for persons with disabilities in different age ranges.\n\nTo what extent do persons with disabilities in or from the jurisdiction or region reside in segregated or integrated settings?\nFor further guidance, see the AFFH Rule Guidebook §5.5.7\nAfter analyzing these dimensions of housing needs, provide an overall summary of housing needs present within your housing market, and an assessment of how these needs relate to those within the broader region. As part of your summary, identify one or two priority populations based upon your assessment of needs and housing impacts within your housing market, and describe the needs of these populations. The priority populations which you identify will constitute the focus of your housing policy platform (your final assignment).\n\nDeliverable \nPrepare your assessment as a memorandum of around 3,000 words. Your memorandum should include sufficient analysis and properly referenced evidence for another housing market expert to measure the strength and validity of your assertions. The judicious use of maps, imagery, and tables should be included to support your analysis.\n\n\nData Notes \nYou will need to construct your own summaries from the AFFH Raw Data – please note that this process is time-consuming – leave yourself plenty of time to work through this. For more specifics on data and indicators, please also see HUD’s data documentation.\n\n\nAssignment Submission \nPlease submit your paper electronically via Canvas."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Drawing directly from the analysis and arguments you made in your first and second assignments, your final assignment asks you to propose a housing policy intervention intended to impact your local housing market. Your analysis should be directed towards a professional audience consisting of planners and other decision-makers, and should be appropriately targeted towards institutions and decisionmakers that best correspond to the geography(ies) which are dictated by the issues which your policy targets.\nYour analysis needs to accomplish several things:\na. Policy Overview – provide a detailed description of the elements of the policy. Through what mechanisms does it create change? How does it interface with other existing policies? How does it relate to the policies you reviewed in Section 2?\nb. Local Precedents – what preexisting goals, policies, or plans support the adoption of your policy?\nc. Eligibility or Impact Criteria – how will the policy selectively target populations at need? How does targeting meet policy goals without creating the potential for disparate impact?\nd. Spatial Impact – which areas, neighborhoods, and populations will be impacted by your policy? How different is your policy’s prospective impact across space?\ne. Timeline, Outcomes and Measures – what are the intended outcomes to be observed if your policy is successfully implemented? Over what period of time will implementation occur? Describe intended outcomes in terms of hard numbers or targets (e.g. 5,000 more affordable housing units serving households at 50%-80% AMI in 10 years). What measures or indicators are the most important ways to identify the success (or failure) of your policy?\nf. Cost and Impact – provide a rough estimate of the cost of your proposal. How does this cost compare to continuing in the current fashion (business as usual)? How does this cost (and related benefits) accrue over the next 5, 10, and 20 years?\nPlease note that there are slightly different outputs from this assignment for undergraduate and graduate students (listed below)."

    "section": "Assignment",
    "text": "Assignment\nFor this assignment, you will investigate the intersection between housing and a topic or area of your choosing. A few examples of some potential intersections you might explore are:\n\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on renters\nHousing affordability for college graduates\nFair housing enforcement following the housing crisis\nRelationship between housing affordability and eviction\nCapital investment in housing in “shrinking” cities\nDesign of green low-income housing\nImpact of capital markets on community development financial institutions (CDFIs)\nDifferential impacts of foreclosures on race, ethnicity, or income group\n\nThis assignment is (purposefully) left quite open. You have a lot of flexibility in defining an area of your interest and then exploring its intersection with our course focus on housing - of course, this openness makes your task more challenging! Your challenge is to identify an intersection that strikes a balance between being sufficiently specific that you can adequately reflect upon it, without being so specific that you are unable to identify supporting evidence for your exposition. As you are researching potential intersections, please bring ideas and questions to our class. Your professor and fellow students are an important resource for appropriately scoping your assignment. Along those lines, proactively working on your assignment will greatly increase the odds that you will have sufficient time to explore and research your intersection thoroughly."

## Description

This week we will explore some of the rationale for government intervention in housing. We'll discuss how housing policy in the United States coalesced at mid-century, and will compare some of the policy goals and strategies from that time to those at present. We'll question how much the mid-century housing crisis has evolved in terms of actors, finance, and material conditions for occupants, and will question how government intervention in housing relates to a range of other social and economic policy questions and concerns.

## Learning Goals

-   Understand the "crisis" conditions at mid-century that prompted the consolidation of policy for housing in the United States.
-   Understand how interventions in housing relate to a range of other urban policy phenomena and outcomes.
-   Become familiar with contemporary policy questions and concerns, and understand how these relate to past questions and concerns.
